# Internal HDD alternatives

While the main internal HDD guide provides one method of setting up an internal hard drive with OPL, there is an alternative method that allow for storage options higher than 2TB and drag and drop OPL game install functionality. However, this option has caveats and will not be covered by this guide. Instead, this page will provide links for more advanced users to pursue or evaluate this option.

## Grimdoomer OPL fork

### Advantages

* Can use HDD storage over 2TB
* Drag and drop game installs and easy deletion

### Caveats

* Currently abandoned and unsupported
* Forks an older version of OPL without later updates/fixes
* Undocumented + (most likely) lesser compatibility compared to main OPL branch
