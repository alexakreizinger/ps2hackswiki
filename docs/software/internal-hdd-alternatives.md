# Internal HDD alternatives

While the main internal HDD guide provides one method of setting up an internal hard drive with OPL, there are alternative, more complex methods that allow for storage options higher than 2TB, drag and drop game install functionality, or avoid the need for a pre-made FMCB card. However, these options have caveats such as undocumented game compatibility or added complexity and will not be covered by this guide. Instead, this page will provide links or summaries for more advanced users to pursue those options.

* Drag and drop game installs and easy deletion

### Caveats

* Currently abandoned and unsupported
* Forks an older version of OPL without later updates/fixes
* Undocumented + (most likely) lesser compatibility compared to main OPL branch
