# Grimdoomer OPL fork

The Grimdoomer fork of OPL allows exFAT HDDs larger than 2TB to be used. However, the fork is currently abandoned, its game compatibility is generally not formally documented, and it is not compatible with Free HDBoot. However, the trade offs may be worth it for users who prefer a larger storage device.

## Advantages

* Can use HDD storage over 2TB
* Drag and drop game installs and easy deletion

## Disadvantages

* Currently abandoned and unsupported
* Forks an older version of OPL without later updates/fixes
* Undocumented and (most likely) lesser compatibility compared to main OPL branch
* Not compatible with Free HDBoot
